# Interview for Backend Focus

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with developing a simple API service that handles requests that include images in them. That API service will then cut out a random square from the image it received, and it will return that cutout image in the response. Optionally, you can connect to an external API to generate a cat on the cutout image, and return that cat cutout in the response.

We ask that you build this service in FastAPI. You do not need to add authentication.

This question is left fairly broad intentionally; it is up to you to decide how you want to handle edge cases and other potential failures with the service. 

We would like to see your code on how you would handle this. To submit this, you can provide us with a link to your code.

**Evaluation Criteria**
- Code Readability and Maintainability
- Functioning Code (does it run?)
- Handling the cases in the problem statement
- Tech decisions and implementation approach based on the problem statement
